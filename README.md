# The Game of Life
Conway's Game of Life

Steps:
1. Choose all the cells from the grid that you want to make alive on the basis of your algorithm. A yellow cell depicts an alive cell whereas a grey cell depicts dead cell.
2. On the basis of the following rules, next generation will be calculated:
      1. For a cell that is alive,
          1. If there are one or no neighbors, the cell dies, as if by solitude.
          2. If there are four or more neighbors, the cell dies, as if by overpopulation.
          3. If there are two or three neighbors, the cell survives.
      2. For a cell that is dead,
          1. If there are three neighbors, the cell get alive.
3. Click the start button to start the game and move the generations ahead.
4. You can control the speed of frames with the help of slider provided.
5. Click the reset button to reset the game back to its original state i.e. all the cells dead.
